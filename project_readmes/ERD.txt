Creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) involves identifying the key entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. Here's an overview of the entities based on the user stories, along with their attributes and relationships:

### Entities and Attributes

   - `is_admin`

2. **Profile**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key to User)
   - `name`
   - `bio`
   - `created_at`
   - `updated_at`

3. **Share**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key to User)
   - `title`

### Relationships

- A **User** can create many **Shares**.

- A **User** can send and receive many **Messages**.
- A **User** can rate many **Shares**.
- A **Share** can have many **Comments**.
- A **Share** can have many **Ratings**.
- An **Admin** (a type of User) can approve/reject **Shares**.
- **ServiceLinks** are standalone and not directly related to other entities but are managed by **Admins**.
