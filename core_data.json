I'd burnt my bridges with them by arguing for them to bring him to me on a real visit.</p><p>I left prison I took the opportunity to contact probation with a request for access, contacted the borough too but each time I was directed to take it to court, being unemployed and having just gas and electric utilities take up a huge amount of the universal credit I was getting I couldn't afford the court application.&nbsp;</p><p>For the first time in over a year my brother called me at 6am Tuesday morning on 5/6/2024, He reached out, He'd told me my Son had died early hours of that morning at Great Ormond Street Hospital having an infection via his Hickman line.&nbsp;</p><p>My life style before Sacha's birth had lead to the consequences that kept me from him, until it was too late to&nbsp; hold him again.</p><p>All I have of him now is the memories of holding, changing him, feeding him, kissing, hugging and loving him (Loving him always...) only for the first three months of his life...</p><p>The last few NA meetings I've heard some really silly, petty and rubbish reasons that people have for why they've relapsed... I've not been able to share my loss with the group I regularly go to, that's why I'm sharing here. I wont use over my loss but it hasn't stopped me feeling the desire to....</p><p><br></p>",
